    The Tortilla Rodeo Co. site has successfully achieved the premium,
    monochromatic aesthetic inspired by promeat.chipsa.design. The core
    functionality is in place with clean, maintainable code.

    Critical path to launch requires fixing dependency issues, configuring
    Stripe, and implementing mobile navigation. With these fixes, the site
    will provide an excellent user experience that positions the brand
    as a premium tortilla reseller.
