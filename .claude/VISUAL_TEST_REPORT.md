## Cross-Browser Testing Recommendation

**Current Testing:** Chromium only (via Playwright)

**Recommended Additional Testing:**
- Firefox: Test for layout differences, CSS compatibility
- Safari/WebKit: Test for iOS-specific issues
- Mobile Safari: Test touch interactions and viewport behavior
- Chrome Android: Verify mobile experience matches iOS

**Known Browser-Specific Concerns:**
- Resources dropdown animation may differ across browsers
- Grid layout fallbacks for older browsers
- Image format support (WebP)

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority (Address Before Launch)
1. Fix logo aspect ratio warning by adding auto sizing CSS
2. Verify Resources dropdown works in Firefox and Safari
3. Test with real mobile devices (not just emulation)
4. Run Lighthouse audit for performance and accessibility scores

### Medium Priority (Post-Launch Improvements)
1. Add loading states for featured recipe images
2. Consider lazy loading for below-the-fold images
3. Test with slow 3G connection to verify experience
4. Add error states for missing images or content
5. Test with browser zoom levels (150%, 200%)

### Low Priority (Future Enhancements)
1. Add skeleton loading states for content discovery cards
2. Consider animation on card hover states for desktop
3. Explore preloading critical resources
4. Add visual regression testing to CI/CD pipeline
