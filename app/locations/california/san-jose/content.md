## Why San Jose Residents Choose Texas Tortillas  

San Jose’s vibrant food scene deserves nothing but the best—and that starts with authentic tortillas. Texans have trusted H-E-B’s tortillas for generations, and now you can too. What makes them special? It’s all in the craft:  

- **Time-Tested Recipes**: H-E-B’s tortillas use the same simple, wholesome ingredients your abuela would—stone-ground corn, unbleached flour, and real butter—with no shortcuts.  
- **Perfect Texture**: Unlike rubbery grocery-store versions, ours stay flexible for rolling *and* develop that irresistible golden char when heated.  
- **Made Fresh Daily**: We ship within hours of production from Texas kitchens, locking in that just-made flavor.  

Folks from Alviso to Almaden tell us our tortillas remind them of San Jose’s best taquerias—because great tortillas are the foundation of every memorable Mexican meal. Whether you're pairing them with Salvadoran pupusas (a local favorite!) or California-style fusion tacos, you’ll taste the difference Texas makes.
