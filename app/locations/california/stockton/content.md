## Why Stockton Residents Choose Texas Tortillas  
When it comes to tortillas, Stockton locals know authenticity matters. Texas tortillas—especially H-E-B’s iconic varieties—have a distinct texture and flavor honed over generations. Unlike thinner, drier alternatives common in California supermarkets, our tortillas are made with premium ingredients like real lard (for flour tortillas) and stone-ground corn, giving them that signature pillowy softness and rich taste.  

H-E-B’s heritage plays a big role. For over 100 years, this Texas grocery legend has perfected its recipes, using time-tested techniques that prioritize freshness and flavor. Stockton home cooks and restaurant owners alike choose our tortillas because they hold up beautifully in dishes like tacos, quesadillas, and tamales without tearing or drying out. Plus, they’re freezer-friendly, so you can stock up and enjoy that just-made taste anytime.  

In a city like Stockton, where Mexican food traditions run deep—from family-run taquerias to home kitchens—quality tortillas are non-negotiable. Ours deliver the authenticity y’all deserve.
