Santa Ana residents know great Mexican food starts with great ingredients, and our tortillas deliver the pliability, freshness, and rich corn or wheat flavor that elevate everything from street tacos to enchiladas.  

But it’s not just about taste—it’s about heritage. H-E-B’s commitment to quality mirrors Santa Ana’s own food values, where meals are meant to be shared and savored. Whether you grew up with Texas traditions or just appreciate truly authentic tortillas, you’ll taste the care in every bite.
