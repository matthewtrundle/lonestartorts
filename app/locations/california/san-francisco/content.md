## Why San Francisco Residents Choose Texas Tortillas  
San Francisco knows great food, and when it comes to tortillas, nothing beats the authentic flavor of Texas. H-E-B tortillas have been a staple in Texan kitchens for decades, crafted with time-honored techniques that prioritize quality over speed. Unlike thinner, store-bought versions, our tortillas boast a hearty texture and rich flavor—thanks to premium non-GMO corn, unbleached flour, and real butter (no shortcuts here!).  

What makes Texas tortillas special? It starts with the process. H-E-B’s corn tortillas are stone-ground for optimal flavor release, while their flour tortillas are slow-kneaded to develop that perfect chew. For San Franciscans who value transparency, our tortillas contain no artificial preservatives or hydrogenated oils—just simple, wholesome ingredients.  

Many Bay Area transplants from Texas swear by H-E-B tortillas as their secret weapon for recreating the smoky brisket tacos of Austin or the bean-and-cheese breakfast tacos of San Antonio. Even local chefs source our tortillas to add authenticity to their dishes. Whether you’re a homesick Texan or a California native seeking the real deal, these tortillas deliver tradition in every bite.  

## Our Products

### Premium Flour Tortillas  
H-E-B’s flour tortillas are a Texas icon, and for good reason: they’re slow-kneaded with unbleached wheat flour and a touch of lard (or oil for our butter variety) for unparalleled elasticity and buttery richness. Ideal for burritos, quesadillas, or simply warmed with a smear of local Straus Family Creamery butter. [Link to: /shop/flour-tortillas]  

### Butter Tortillas  
Indulge in H-E-B’s cult-favorite butter tortillas, where real butter is folded into the dough for a melt-in-your-mouth experience. These slightly sweet, ultra-soft tortillas elevate simple meals—think scrambled eggs with avocado or cinnamon-sugar dessert roll-ups. A hit with San Francisco families and brunch enthusiasts alike.

## San Francisco’s Mexican Food Scene  
San Francisco’s Mexican food culture is as diverse as the city itself. The Mission District’s legendary taquerias—like La Taqueria and El Farolito—have set the bar high with their iconic burritos and carnitas tacos. Across the Bay, Oakland’s Fruitvale neighborhood celebrates Oaxacan and Jalisco traditions, while home cooks from Noe Valley to Potrero Hill experiment with hybrid creations like Dungeness crab tacos or kimchi quesadillas.  

Yet even in this foodie paradise, finding truly authentic tortillas can be a challenge. Many local spots rely on commercial brands that lack the depth of handmade Texas tortillas. That’s where we come in. Our customers—from home chefs to pop-up taco stands—use H-E-B tortillas to replicate the textures and flavors found in Mexico and Texas. Picture a crispy fish taco from Outerlands with our corn tortillas as the base, or a sourdough quesadilla (yes, this is SF!) made with our butter tortillas. Whether you’re hosting a Dia de los Muertos gathering in Bernal Heights or meal-prepping lunches for FiDi, our tortillas let you craft restaurant-quality dishes at home.
