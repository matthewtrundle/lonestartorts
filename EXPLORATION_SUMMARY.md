### Critical Gaps for Shopping Cart

1. **No Cart State Management**
   - No React Context, Zustand, Redux, or similar
   - ProductCard has `onAddToOrder` callback but no implementation

2. **No Cart UI**
   - No sidebar/modal cart component
   - No cart icon in header
   - No cart page

3. **Product Data Issues**
   - Product catalog hardcoded in checkout API
   - No product database/API endpoint
   - No inventory tracking
   - No product variants or options

4. **Order Persistence**
   - Webhook stores orders in-memory Map (lost on server restart)
   - Must migrate to Prisma database
   - No order history retrieval for users

5. **Missing Pages**
   - No dedicated checkout page/flow
   - No order tracking page implementation

---

## Architecture Summary

### Current Data Flow

```
User → ProductCard → [No Handler] 
         (clicks "Add to Order")

User → Pre-Sale Page → Waitlist Signup → API → Prisma DB
         (current flow)

Future:
User → ProductCard → Cart Context → CartUI → Checkout Page → Stripe
```

## File Structure Deep Dive

### App Routes (27 pages total)

**Core Pages**:
- `/page.tsx` - Homepage (pre-sale landing)
- `/pre-sale/page.tsx` - Waitlist registration (fully functional)
- `/success/page.tsx` - Post-purchase confirmation
- `/track/page.tsx` - Order tracking (stub)
- `/shop/page.tsx` - Redirects to pre-sale

**Product Pages**:
- `/products/corn-tortillas/page.tsx`
- `/products/flour-tortillas/page.tsx`
- `/products/butter-tortillas/page.tsx`
- `/products/specialty-tortillas/page.tsx`

**Content Pages** (32 total including guides, recipes, blog)

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/checkout` - Stripe session creation
- `POST/GET /api/webhook` - Payment webhooks & order tracking
- `POST/GET /api/waitlist` - Waitlist management
- Admin endpoints for management

### Components (20 total)

**High Priority for Cart**:
- `ProductCard.tsx` - Has `onAddToOrder` callback (needs wiring)
- `DisclaimerBanner.tsx` - H-E-B compliance (reuse in cart)
- Layout components for structure

**Existing Infrastructure**:
- Analytics tracking components
- Breadcrumbs navigation
- Logo (animated)
- SEO metadata

### Database Schema (8 models)

**Critical for Cart**:
- **Order** - Main orders table (well-designed, items stored as JSON)
- **WaitlistEntry** - Pre-sale tracking (complete)
- User/Session - Admin authentication
- Note/EmailLog - Audit trails

**Gaps**:
- No Product table (needed for catalog)
- No Cart/CartItem tables (not needed if using Context)
- No inventory tracking

### Library Code

**Analytics** (`lib/analytics.ts`):
- Already has `trackAddToCart()`, `trackBeginCheckout()`, `trackPurchase()`
- Ready to integrate with cart

**Utilities** (`lib/utils.ts`):
- `cn()` - Classname utility
- `formatPrice()` - Currency formatting

**Prisma** (`lib/prisma.ts`):
- Singleton client with proper Node env handling

## Compliance & Security Notes

### H-E-B® Compliance
- Mandatory disclaimer appears in 4+ locations
- No H-E-B logos or trade dress used
- Proper nominative fair use framing
- ALLOW_REFRIGERATED=false (prevents selling cold items)

### Security Observations
- Stripe webhook signature verification implemented
- API keys properly separated (.env.local)
- ADMIN_TOKEN for API protection
- No secrets in code

### Potential Improvements
- Add rate limiting to API endpoints
- Implement CSRF protection if forms added
- Validate all user inputs server-side
- Add error monitoring (Sentry)

---

## Integration Readiness

### Ready for Implementation
- Stripe checkout API endpoint exists
- Webhook processing configured
- Success page template ready
- Analytics tracking functions exist
- Database schema supports orders
- UI component library available

### Needs Implementation (See CART_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- Cart Context/state management
- Cart UI components (sidebar/modal)
- Product catalog endpoint
- Checkout page
- Product card integration
- Persistent storage (localStorage)

### Recommended Priority
1. Create CartContext with localStorage
2. Build CartSidebar component
3. Create /checkout page
4. Update ProductCard with cart integration
5. Wire up analytics events
6. Test end-to-end with Stripe test mode
7. Migrate webhook to save orders to Prisma
